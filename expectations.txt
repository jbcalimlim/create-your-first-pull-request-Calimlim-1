********************** My Expectations ****************************************************
As a student of CMSC 100, I expect to learn a lot especially in web development and in teamwork. 
I expect to be ready and prepared in doing full-stack web development by learning the skills
needed and expected in the industry. I also expect to make new friends along the way and foster friendly 
collaborations with my classmates.

Edit - I hope you expectations will be met and I hope you get a good semester also.
